<h1>Antidepressant medications: what to actually expect</h1>
<div class="meta">Updated February 2026 &middot; 10 min read</div>

<p>Starting an antidepressant comes with a lot of uncertainty. Will it work? How long before you feel different? What about side effects? The internet is full of both horror stories and miracle accounts, and neither extreme reflects the typical experience.</p>

<p>This guide covers the major classes of antidepressant medications, what the clinical evidence says about their effectiveness, and practical information about the process of finding the right one. It's not a substitute for working with a prescriber — it's meant to help you understand the conversation.</p>

<div class="note-box">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Never start, stop, or change the dose of an antidepressant without consulting your prescribing physician. Abrupt discontinuation can cause withdrawal symptoms and rebound depression.</p>
</div>

<h2>How antidepressants work</h2>

<p>Most antidepressants work by altering the levels or activity of neurotransmitters — chemical messengers in the brain. The three neurotransmitters most commonly targeted are serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. The original "chemical imbalance" theory of depression has been largely superseded by a more complex understanding involving neuroplasticity, inflammation, and neural circuit dysfunction, but these medications remain effective regardless of the precise mechanism.</p>

<p>The delay between starting medication and feeling its effects — typically 2 to 6 weeks — reflects this complexity. Neurotransmitter levels change within hours of the first dose, but the downstream effects on neural circuits, gene expression, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) take weeks to develop.</p>

<h2>SSRIs: the usual starting point</h2>

<p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants and the recommended first-line treatment in most clinical guidelines. They work by blocking the reabsorption of serotonin in the brain, increasing its availability.</p>

<p>Common SSRIs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sertraline (Zoloft)</strong> — generally well-tolerated, broad evidence base, often a first choice</li>
<li><strong>Escitalopram (Lexapro)</strong> — considered one of the most selective SSRIs, tends to have fewer drug interactions</li>
<li><strong>Fluoxetine (Prozac)</strong> — long half-life makes it more forgiving of missed doses, FDA-approved for adolescents</li>
<li><strong>Paroxetine (Paxil)</strong> — effective but has a higher incidence of weight gain and withdrawal symptoms</li>
<li><strong>Citalopram (Celexa)</strong> — similar to escitalopram, dose-limited due to cardiac concerns at high doses</li>
</ul>

<p>The STAR*D study — the largest antidepressant effectiveness trial ever conducted, funded by the NIMH — found that about 37% of patients achieved remission with their first SSRI (citalopram in the study). That number may sound low, but it's worth contextualizing: the trial included patients with chronic, recurrent depression and significant comorbidities. In clinical practice with a broader population, response rates tend to be higher.</p>

<p>Common side effects include nausea (usually subsides in 1-2 weeks), headache, insomnia or drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction (which affects 30-40% of patients and often persists). Weight changes vary by drug. These side effects are usually most pronounced in the first two weeks and diminish with time.</p>

<h2>SNRIs: dual-action alternatives</h2>

<p>Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors target both serotonin and norepinephrine. They're typically considered when SSRIs haven't worked or when depression includes significant fatigue, pain, or concentration difficulties — symptoms more associated with norepinephrine.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Venlafaxine (Effexor)</strong> — well-studied, available in extended-release form, but withdrawal can be challenging</li>
<li><strong>Duloxetine (Cymbalta)</strong> — also FDA-approved for chronic pain conditions, useful when depression and pain co-occur</li>
<li><strong>Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq)</strong> — active metabolite of venlafaxine, may have a more predictable dose-response</li>
</ul>

<p>Side effects overlap with SSRIs but may include elevated blood pressure at higher doses (particularly venlafaxine). Blood pressure monitoring is recommended.</p>

<h2>Atypical antidepressants</h2>

<p>Several medications don't fit neatly into the SSRI or SNRI categories but have good evidence for depression:</p>

<p><strong>Bupropion (Wellbutrin)</strong> acts on norepinephrine and dopamine rather than serotonin. It stands apart from most antidepressants in two important ways: it doesn't cause sexual dysfunction (and may actually improve it), and it tends to be weight-neutral or promote modest weight loss. It's a common choice when these side effects are concerns. However, it's less effective for depression with significant anxiety and is contraindicated in people with seizure disorders or eating disorders.</p>

<p><strong>Mirtazapine (Remeron)</strong> works through a different mechanism involving norepinephrine and serotonin receptors. It's sedating and appetite-stimulating, which makes it useful for depression presenting with severe insomnia and weight loss. These properties are drawbacks for people who don't need them.</p>

<h2>The first six weeks</h2>

<p>The early period of treatment is the hardest. Side effects are at their peak, the therapeutic effect hasn't kicked in yet, and it's easy to conclude the medication isn't working. Here's a realistic timeline:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Side effects are most noticeable. Some people experience increased anxiety, especially with SSRIs. Energy may improve slightly before mood does.</li>
<li><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Side effects begin to stabilize. Early signs of improvement may appear — often noticed by others before the person themselves. Sleep and appetite may normalize.</li>
<li><strong>Week 4-6:</strong> Full therapeutic effect typically emerges. If there's been no meaningful improvement by week 6, a dosage adjustment or medication change is usually appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>The STAR*D trial demonstrated that failing to respond to the first medication doesn't mean medication won't work. About 25% of patients who didn't respond to the first drug achieved remission with a second. Overall, across four treatment steps, about 67% of patients eventually achieved remission. Persistence matters.</p>

<h2>When to switch or augment</h2>

<p>If a medication hasn't produced meaningful improvement after 6 to 8 weeks at an adequate dose, common strategies include switching to a different medication (often from a different class), augmenting with a second medication (such as adding bupropion to an SSRI), or adding an atypical antipsychotic like aripiprazole, which has FDA approval as an adjunct for treatment-resistant depression.</p>

<p>The decision between switching and augmenting depends on whether the first medication provided partial benefit (augment) or no benefit at all (switch).</p>

<h2>Discontinuation</h2>

<p>When it's time to stop an antidepressant — whether due to remission, side effects, or switching — tapering slowly is essential. Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome can include dizziness, nausea, irritability, "brain zaps" (electric shock sensations), and flu-like symptoms. Paroxetine and venlafaxine have the highest discontinuation rates.</p>

<p>Current guidelines recommend tapering over at least 4 weeks, with longer tapers for people who have been on medication for more than a year. Some patients need even slower tapers. This is a conversation to have with your prescriber, not a decision to make independently.</p>

<h2>Medication isn't the whole answer</h2>

<p>Antidepressants are most effective when combined with psychotherapy. The combination of medication and CBT, for example, has consistently shown higher remission rates than either treatment alone. Medication can reduce the intensity of symptoms enough to make therapy productive, and therapy can address the cognitive and behavioral patterns that medication alone doesn't change.</p>

<p>Thinking of medication as one component of a treatment plan — alongside therapy, lifestyle changes, and social support — is more realistic and more effective than viewing it as a standalone solution.</p>
