<h1>Therapy for depression: what the evidence says about each approach</h1>
<div class="meta">Updated February 2026 &middot; 9 min read</div>

<p>The word "therapy" gets used so loosely that it can be hard to know what you're actually signing up for. There are dozens of psychotherapy models, each with its own theory of how depression develops and what to do about it. Not all of them have strong evidence behind them.</p>

<p>This guide covers the approaches with the most clinical support, what each one involves in practice, and how to think about which might be the right fit. The goal isn't to rank them — it's to give you enough information to have a productive conversation with a potential therapist.</p>

<h2>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h2>

<p>CBT is the most studied psychotherapy for depression, with hundreds of randomized controlled trials behind it. The core premise is straightforward: depression is maintained by distorted patterns of thinking (cognitive distortions) and avoidant behaviors, and systematically correcting both can lift mood.</p>

<p>In practice, CBT is structured and time-limited, typically running 12 to 20 sessions. Sessions follow an agenda. You'll learn to identify automatic negative thoughts ("I always fail," "Nothing will get better"), examine the evidence for and against those thoughts, and develop more balanced alternatives. Behavioral components include scheduling pleasurable activities, breaking tasks into manageable steps, and gradually re-engaging with avoided situations.</p>

<p>A major meta-analysis published in <em>Psychological Bulletin</em> (Cuijpers et al., 2013) found CBT to be as effective as antidepressant medication for mild-to-moderate depression, with lower relapse rates after treatment ends. The structured nature also makes it well-suited for telehealth delivery, which broadened access significantly during and after the pandemic.</p>

<p>CBT works best for people who are comfortable with a goal-oriented, homework-based approach. If you want to understand the deep origins of your feelings, CBT may feel too surface-level. If you want practical tools you can start using this week, it's a strong choice.</p>

<h2>Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)</h2>

<p>IPT takes a different angle. Rather than focusing on thought patterns, it treats depression as fundamentally connected to problems in relationships and social roles. The therapy targets one of four domains: grief, role disputes (conflicts with important people), role transitions (divorce, retirement, job loss), or interpersonal deficits (difficulty forming and maintaining relationships).</p>

<p>Sessions are typically 12 to 16 weeks. The therapist helps you identify which interpersonal problem area is most connected to your depression, then works with you to address it directly — improving communication, processing loss, or navigating a life change.</p>

<p>The evidence for IPT is substantial. The National Institute of Mental Health's Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Program — one of the largest psychotherapy trials ever conducted — found IPT comparable to medication for moderate depression. It's particularly well-supported for postpartum depression and depression in older adults. A 2011 Cochrane review confirmed IPT's efficacy and noted that it may be especially helpful when depression has a clear interpersonal trigger.</p>

<h2>Behavioral Activation (BA)</h2>

<p>Behavioral activation strips away the cognitive components of CBT and focuses entirely on behavior. The model is simple: depression leads to withdrawal, withdrawal leads to loss of positive reinforcement, and that loss deepens the depression. Breaking the cycle means increasing engagement with rewarding activities, even — especially — when motivation is absent.</p>

<p>This sounds too simple to work, but the data disagrees. A landmark study published in <em>The Lancet</em> (Richards et al., 2016) found that behavioral activation delivered by junior mental health workers was as effective as CBT delivered by experienced therapists. This has significant implications for access, since BA requires less training to deliver.</p>

<p>BA typically involves activity monitoring (tracking what you do and how it affects your mood), scheduling activities aligned with your values, and gradually reducing avoidance behaviors. Sessions usually span 12 to 16 weeks. It's pragmatic, low-cost relative to other approaches, and particularly useful for people whose depression manifests primarily as inactivity and withdrawal.</p>

<h2>Psychodynamic Therapy</h2>

<p>Psychodynamic therapy explores how unconscious processes, early life experiences, and unresolved conflicts shape current emotional patterns. It's rooted in psychoanalytic tradition but has evolved considerably from the stereotypical image of lying on a couch five days a week.</p>

<p>Modern short-term psychodynamic therapy (STPP) typically runs 16 to 24 sessions. The therapist helps you identify recurring emotional themes, understand how past relationships influence present ones, and develop insight into defensive patterns that may be contributing to depression.</p>

<p>The evidence base is thinner than for CBT or IPT but growing. A meta-analysis by Driessen et al. (2015) in the <em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em> found short-term psychodynamic therapy effective for depression, with large effect sizes. However, it may be particularly relevant for people with chronic or recurrent depression linked to personality factors or attachment difficulties, where addressing underlying patterns — not just symptoms — matters.</p>

<h2>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</h2>

<p>DBT was originally developed for borderline personality disorder, but components of it are increasingly used for depression, particularly when emotional dysregulation is prominent. DBT combines cognitive-behavioral techniques with mindfulness practices and emphasizes developing skills in four areas: distress tolerance, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, and mindfulness.</p>

<p>Full DBT is intensive — individual therapy plus skills groups plus phone coaching. However, DBT skills training alone has shown benefits for depression in several studies. A 2015 randomized trial in <em>Behaviour Research and Therapy</em> found that a 16-week DBT skills group significantly reduced depression symptoms compared to a waitlist control.</p>

<p>DBT is worth considering when depression co-occurs with difficulty managing intense emotions, self-harm, or chronic suicidal ideation.</p>

<h2>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)</h2>

<p>MBCT combines elements of CBT with mindfulness meditation practices. Its primary evidence base is in preventing relapse — it was specifically designed for people who have recovered from depression but are at risk of recurrence.</p>

<p>The therapy runs as an 8-week group program. Participants learn to recognize early warning signs of depressive relapse and respond with mindfulness techniques rather than habitual rumination. A meta-analysis by Kuyken et al. (2016) in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em> found that MBCT reduced the risk of depressive relapse by 31% compared to usual care, with the strongest effects in people with three or more prior episodes.</p>

<h2>Choosing an approach</h2>

<p>The honest answer is that for most people with mild-to-moderate depression, the specific type of therapy matters less than the quality of the therapeutic relationship and the person's engagement with the process. A 2019 network meta-analysis in <em>World Psychiatry</em> (Cuijpers et al.) found that all major evidence-based therapies produced similar outcomes on average.</p>

<p>That said, some practical considerations help narrow the field:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want structured, skill-based work with homework: CBT or BA</li>
<li>If your depression is tied to a relationship problem or life transition: IPT</li>
<li>If you've had multiple depressive episodes and want relapse prevention: MBCT</li>
<li>If you sense that long-standing emotional patterns are at play: psychodynamic therapy</li>
<li>If emotional volatility or self-harm is part of the picture: DBT</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important step is starting. You can always switch approaches if the first one doesn't click. A good therapist will discuss the rationale for their approach openly, set clear goals, and check in on progress regularly.</p>
