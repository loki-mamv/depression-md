<h1>Seasonal affective disorder: more than the "winter blues"</h1>
<div class="meta">Updated February 2026 &middot; 8 min read</div>

<p>Every year, as the days shorten and the light fades, millions of people experience a predictable slide into depression. It starts with sluggishness, progresses to persistent low mood, and lifts — almost like clockwork — when spring arrives. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) has been recognized as a clinical entity since the 1980s, but many people still dismiss it as a minor inconvenience or a lack of willpower.</p>

<p>It's neither. SAD is a recurrent form of major depression with a seasonal pattern, and it can be debilitating. The good news is that its predictability makes it more treatable than many forms of depression — if you take it seriously and intervene early.</p>

<h2>Who gets it and why</h2>

<p>SAD affects an estimated 5% of the U.S. adult population, with another 10-20% experiencing a milder form sometimes called "subsyndromal SAD" or the winter blues. It's far more common at higher latitudes — prevalence in Alaska is roughly 9%, compared to about 1.5% in Florida — which points directly to the role of daylight.</p>

<p>Women are diagnosed with SAD about four times more often than men, though it's unclear how much of this reflects actual prevalence versus differences in help-seeking behavior. The typical age of onset is between 18 and 30, and the condition tends to recur annually.</p>

<p>The biological explanation centers on light's effect on two systems in the brain:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Circadian rhythm disruption.</strong> The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus uses light signals from the retina to synchronize the body's internal clock. Reduced winter light can cause this clock to drift, leading to a mismatch between internal timing and the external environment. This is called a circadian phase delay, and it produces symptoms that overlap substantially with depression: fatigue, hypersomnia, difficulty concentrating, and low mood.</li>
<li><strong>Serotonin regulation.</strong> Serotonin transporter (SERT) activity increases in winter, meaning more serotonin is cleared from the synapse. A PET imaging study by McMahon et al. (2016) in <em>Brain</em> demonstrated that people with SAD show significantly greater seasonal variation in SERT binding than healthy controls. The result is functionally lower serotonin availability during darker months.</li>
<li><strong>Melatonin overproduction.</strong> The pineal gland produces melatonin in response to darkness. Longer nights mean extended melatonin secretion, which contributes to the oversleeping, lethargy, and low energy characteristic of winter-type SAD.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Symptoms: what it actually looks like</h2>

<p>Winter-pattern SAD shares the core symptoms of major depression — persistent low mood, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness — but has a distinct atypical profile that sets it apart from the "classic" depressive presentation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hypersomnia rather than insomnia (sleeping 10+ hours and still feeling exhausted)</li>
<li>Increased appetite, particularly for carbohydrates and comfort foods</li>
<li>Weight gain (averaging 5-10 pounds per winter season in clinical samples)</li>
<li>A heavy, leaden feeling in the arms and legs</li>
<li>Social withdrawal that feels more like hibernation than avoidance</li>
</ul>

<p>The pattern typically begins in October or November, peaks in January and February, and resolves by April. Some people experience a less common summer-pattern SAD characterized by insomnia, decreased appetite, weight loss, agitation, and anxiety — essentially the inverse symptom profile.</p>

<h2>Light therapy: the first-line treatment</h2>

<p>Bright light therapy is the most-studied and most specifically effective treatment for SAD. It works by compensating for reduced natural light exposure and resetting the circadian clock.</p>

<p>The standard protocol involves sitting in front of a 10,000-lux light box for 20 to 30 minutes each morning, ideally within the first hour of waking. The light should be broad-spectrum white light (not full-spectrum or blue-enriched, despite marketing claims), positioned about 16 to 24 inches from the face. You don't stare directly at it — you go about your morning routine while the light enters your visual field peripherally.</p>

<p>A multicenter randomized controlled trial published in <em>JAMA Psychiatry</em> (Lam et al., 2016) found that light therapy was as effective as fluoxetine (Prozac) for SAD, and the combination of both was more effective than either alone. Response typically occurs within 1 to 2 weeks, faster than most antidepressants.</p>

<p>Common mistakes that reduce effectiveness include using the light box in the evening (which can worsen circadian misalignment), using a device with insufficient lux (many consumer products fall short of 10,000 lux at the recommended distance), and inconsistent use. SAD recurs every year, so light therapy needs to start proactively in early fall and continue through spring.</p>

<h2>Medication</h2>

<p>SSRIs are effective for SAD. Fluoxetine and sertraline have the most evidence, and bupropion XL (Wellbutrin XL) is the only medication with FDA approval specifically for preventing recurrent SAD episodes. The PREVENT study (Modell et al., 2005) demonstrated that starting bupropion XL in early fall significantly reduced the rate of depressive recurrence compared to placebo.</p>

<p>For people with moderate-to-severe SAD, combining light therapy with medication produces better outcomes than either alone — mirroring the pattern seen in non-seasonal depression treatment.</p>

<h2>Cognitive-behavioral therapy for SAD (CBT-SAD)</h2>

<p>A modified form of CBT specifically adapted for seasonal depression has shown promising results. CBT-SAD addresses the behavioral withdrawal and negative cognitions specific to winter — thoughts like "I can't do anything in winter" or "I won't feel better until spring" — and includes behavioral activation components designed to counteract seasonal inactivity.</p>

<p>A head-to-head trial by Rohan et al. (2016) in the <em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em> compared CBT-SAD to light therapy over two winters. In the first winter, both treatments performed equally. By the second winter, CBT-SAD showed a significant advantage: the recurrence rate was 27% for CBT-SAD versus 46% for light therapy. The likely explanation is that CBT teaches durable skills that persist after treatment ends, whereas the benefits of light therapy stop when you stop using it.</p>

<h2>Practical strategies</h2>

<p>Beyond formal treatment, several evidence-informed strategies can reduce the severity of SAD:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Maximize natural light exposure.</strong> Outdoor light, even on cloudy winter days, is substantially brighter than indoor lighting (overcast sky: ~10,000 lux; typical office: ~500 lux). A 30-minute morning walk outdoors provides both light exposure and exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain a consistent sleep schedule.</strong> Going to bed and waking up at the same time reinforces circadian rhythms. Avoid the temptation to extend sleep on weekends.</li>
<li><strong>Stay socially engaged.</strong> The pull toward isolation is strong in SAD, and social withdrawal deepens the depression. Scheduling regular social contact — even when you'd rather not — counteracts this pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin D supplementation.</strong> People at northern latitudes frequently become vitamin D deficient in winter, and low vitamin D levels are associated with depression. While supplementation hasn't been conclusively shown to treat SAD, correcting a deficiency is reasonable general practice.</li>
<li><strong>Plan proactively.</strong> Because SAD follows a predictable schedule, you can prepare. Start light therapy in September or October, before symptoms develop. Schedule more social activities during peak months. Build the support structures before you need them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The predictability of SAD is, paradoxically, its greatest advantage. Unlike other forms of depression that strike without warning, SAD announces itself on the calendar. Taking it seriously — treating it as the clinical condition it is rather than a vague seasonal mood shift — makes a measurable difference.</p>
