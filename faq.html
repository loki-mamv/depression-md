            <h2>What is major depression?</h2>
            <p>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a serious mental health condition characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, and a range of emotional and physical symptoms that significantly interfere with daily life. Symptoms must be present for at least two weeks for diagnosis. It affects 21 million American adults annually (8.4% of the population) and is the leading cause of disability worldwide.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What causes depression?</h2>
            <p>Depression results from a complex interaction of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. These include neurotransmitter imbalances (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine), genetics (40% heritability), brain structure changes, chronic stress, childhood adversity, trauma, medical conditions, and certain medications. No single cause fully explains depression — it's a multifactorial condition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How is depression treated?</h2>
            <p>Depression is highly treatable. Evidence-based treatments include psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Interpersonal Therapy), antidepressant medications (SSRIs, SNRIs), or a combination of both. For severe or treatment-resistant depression, options include Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), and esketamine. Approximately 80-90% of people with depression respond to treatment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Is depression the same as sadness?</h2>
            <p>No. Sadness is a normal emotion that everyone experiences in response to difficult situations and typically passes with time. Depression is a persistent medical condition lasting weeks, months, or years, characterized by pervasive low mood, loss of interest in activities, cognitive changes (difficulty concentrating, negative thinking), and physical symptoms (sleep changes, fatigue, appetite changes). Depression often has no clear external cause and significantly impairs daily functioning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Can depression be cured?</h2>
            <p>While there's no permanent "cure," depression is highly treatable and many people achieve full remission (complete absence of symptoms). Approximately 50% of people experience a single depressive episode. For those with recurrent depression, ongoing treatment (maintenance therapy with medication or periodic psychotherapy) can prevent relapse. Most people can manage depression successfully with appropriate treatment and lead fulfilling lives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How long does depression treatment take?</h2>
            <p>Timeline varies by treatment and individual. Most people begin to notice improvement within 4-6 weeks of starting treatment. Psychotherapy (CBT or IPT) typically lasts 12-16 sessions. Antidepressants should be continued for 6-12 months after achieving remission to prevent relapse. Some people benefit from longer-term maintenance treatment, especially those with recurrent depression. Treatment-resistant depression may require longer or more intensive interventions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Is depression genetic?</h2>
            <p>Genetics account for approximately 40% of depression risk (heritability estimate from twin studies). First-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) of people with depression have a 2-3 times higher risk of developing depression. However, depression is not purely genetic — environmental factors, life experiences, stress, and other biological factors also play major roles. Having a family history increases risk but does not guarantee you will develop depression.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What should I do if I think I have depression?</h2>
            <p>Start by talking to your primary care physician or a mental health professional (psychologist, psychiatrist, licensed therapist). You can take a PHQ-9 screening questionnaire to assess symptom severity. Seek professional evaluation if symptoms persist for more than two weeks, interfere with work or relationships, or include thoughts of self-harm. Early intervention leads to better outcomes. If you're in crisis or having thoughts of suicide, call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) immediately.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Are antidepressants addictive?</h2>
            <p>No, antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs) are not addictive in the way substances like opioids or benzodiazepines are. They don't produce cravings or compulsive use. However, stopping them abruptly can cause discontinuation symptoms (dizziness, nausea, irritability), so they should be tapered gradually under medical supervision. Antidepressants don't alter your personality or create dependence — they restore normal neurotransmitter function.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>How do I know if therapy or medication is right for me?</h2>
            <p>For mild depression, psychotherapy (CBT or IPT) is often recommended first. For moderate-to-severe depression, either medication or psychotherapy (or both) are appropriate — choice depends on patient preference, prior treatment response, and availability. Combination therapy (therapy + medication) shows the best outcomes for severe depression. Discuss options with your healthcare provider to make an informed decision based on your specific situation, symptoms, and goals.</p>
